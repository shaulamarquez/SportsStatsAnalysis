    "# Interpretation of Each Correlation\n",
    "1. Total count and medal count (0.91):\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a strong positive correlation between the total number of USA athletes and the number of medals won. This suggests that when more athletes participate, the number of medals won tends to increase as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Total count and gold count (0.82):\n",
    "\n",
    "A strong positive correlation exists between the total number of USA athletes and the number of gold medals won. More athletes likely lead to more opportunities for gold.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Total count and silver count (0.80):\n",
    "\n",
    "This also shows a strong positive correlation between the total athlete count and silver medals, suggesting a similar pattern as for gold medals.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Total count and bronze count (0.88):\n",
    "\n",
    "The strong positive correlation here indicates that an increase in the number of athletes has a particularly high association with the number of bronze medals won.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Medal count and gold count (0.92):\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of medals won and the number of gold medals show a very strong positive correlation, indicating that gold medals contribute heavily to the total medal count.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Medal count and silver count (0.89):\n",
    "\n",
    "A strong positive correlation between total medal count and silver medals suggests that silver medals also significantly contribute to the total.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Medal count and bronze count (0.89):\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to gold and silver, bronze medals are also strongly correlated with the overall medal count.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Gold count and silver count (0.68):\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s a moderate positive correlation between gold and silver medals, indicating that while there's some relationship, winning gold does not strongly predict winning silver.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Gold count and bronze count (0.71):\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s a moderate positive correlation between gold and bronze medals, showing a similar trend as with silver.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Silver count and bronze count (0.80):\n",
    "\n",
    "A strong positive correlation between silver and bronze medals suggests that when the USA wins more silver medals, they also tend to win more bronze medals.\n",

    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overall, there is a strong relationship between the total number of athletes and the number of medals won, indicating that increasing athlete participation tends to increase medal counts.\n",
    "- All medal types (gold, silver, and bronze) contribute significantly to the total medal count, though gold has the strongest influence.\n",
    "- The moderate correlations between the different medal types suggest that while winning one type of medal increases the likelihood of winning others, it’s not a perfect predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "This matrix reveals that higher athlete participation tends to positively impact the USA’s success in winning medals across all types."
